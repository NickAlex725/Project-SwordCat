Feel free to name the prefabs as you see fit, the ones we currently have in the folder are just examples/ideas

For when you enter a new level/area, it would be better to place the enemies inside the play area.

But for when you want to spawn new enemies/waves, it would be better to place the enemies outside the play area so it looks like they naturally wandered in instead of suddenly spawning out of nowhere

Individual enemies will spawn where you have placed the Spawner, but Wave Enemies will spawn exactly as they are located in the prefab.
